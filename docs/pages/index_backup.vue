          Scalar is a first-of-its-kind CSS framework for helping you quickly
          build typographically rich, mathematically beautiful, completely
          custom layouts that maintain their visual integrity across every
          device and breakpoint.

      <p>
        Following in the tradition of other highly-customizable CSS utility
        frameworks like Tailwind, Scalar generates a low-level, class-based API
        that helps you rapidly build unique layouts without forcing you to
        override base styles.

      <icon-block icon="waveform" title="Responsive, yet precise">
        Scalar takes advantage of the latest CSS functionality and a pioneering
        approach to CSS to keep your design consistent, no matter the viewport.

      <icon-block icon="typography" title="Rich Typography">
        Modify font properties, vertical rhythm, margins, line heights, and
        modular scales at any breakpoint to get the right type stylinhg for each
        screen.

        Scalar’s composable plugins and configs allows you to opt-in, out, or
        even build your own, to ensure you have 100% control over your final
        CSS.
      </icon-block>
      <icon-block icon="accessible" title="Accessible">
        Many existing “fluid” font techniques inhibit accessibility. Scalar
        works without breaking accessibility and doesn’t use obscure calc
        statements.

      <p>
        Scalar and fluid web design give us an ability to design and build web
        sites in a new way that gives us greater control and precision over
        typography, layout, and copywriting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you’re a designer or a developer, prepare for an in-depth,
        guided course and walk-through of all the building blocks and essential
        concepts behind fluid web design. You’ll be learning from the creator of
        Scalar himself, Kether Saturnius, a 20 year veteran of the web industry
        who spent the first half of his career as a designer.
